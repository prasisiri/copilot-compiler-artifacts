### Phase H: Architecture Change Management
- Ensures that the architecture achieves its original target business value.
- Objectives:
    - Ensures that the Enterprise Architecture Capability meets current requirements.

### Requirements Management
- Manages architecture requirements identified during any execution of the ADM cycle or a phase.
- Ensures that relevant architecture requirements are available for use by each phase as the phase is executed.

### Architecture Principles
- Typically developed by the Enterprise Architects, in conjunction with the key stakeholders, and are approved by the Architecture Board.
- Must be clearly traceable and clearly articulated to guide decision-making.
- Criteria for a good set of principles:
    - Understandable
    - Robust
    - Complete
    - Consistent
    - Stable

### Enterprise Continuum
- A categorization for assets held in the Enterprise Repositories that provides methods for classifying assets, including architecture and solution artifacts as they evolve from generic Foundation Architectures to Organization-Specific Architectures.
- Components:
    - Architecture Continuum
    - Solutions Continuum

### Architecture Governance
- The practice and orientation by which Enterprise Architectures and other architectures are managed and controlled at an enterprise-wide level.
- Ensures compliance of individual projects with the Enterprise Architecture.
- The Governance Repository provides a record of governance activity across the enterprise.

### Architecture Repository
- Major components:
    - Architecture Metamodel
    - Solutions Landscape
    - Architecture Requirements Repository
    - Architecture Landscape
    - Reference Library
    - Standards Library
    - Governance Repository
    - Architecture Capability

### Building Blocks
- Characteristics:
    - A package of functionality defined to meet the business needs across an organization.
    - Ideally re-usable and replaceable, and well specified.
- Types:
    - Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs)
    - Solution Building Blocks (SBBs)

### Risk Management
- Identifies risks and improvement actions.
- Classifies, assesses, mitigates, and monitors risk.
- Levels of risk:
    - Initial Level of Risk
    - Residual Level of Risk

### Business Transformation Readiness Assessment
- Used for evaluating and quantifying an organization’s readiness to undergo change.
- Readiness factors are presented using maturity models.
- Mitigation actions are worked into ADM Phase E and F Implementation and Migration Plan.

### Miscellaneous
- The TOGAF Standard is an open, industry consensus framework for Enterprise Architecture.
- The TOGAF Documentation Set consists of The TOGAF Standard, TOGAF Fundamental Content, TOGAF Series Guides, and TOGAF Library.
- The ADM supports a number of concepts that are characterized as iteration.
- The TOGAF Standard may use a variety of modeling languages, such as ArchiMate®, BPMN™, UML®, etc.
- The Content Framework defines a categorization framework to be used to describe the Building Blocks and artifacts reflecting decisions taken in creating the overall architecture deliverables.

### Definitions
- **Stakeholders**: Individuals, teams, organizations, or classes thereof, having an interest in a system.
- **Concerns**: Interests in a system relevant to one or more of its stakeholders.
- **Architecture View**: A representation of a system from the perspective of a related set of concerns.
- **Architecture Viewpoint**: A specification of the conventions for a particular kind of Architecture View.
- **Deliverable**: A work product that is contractually specified and in turn formally reviewed, approved, and signed off by the stakeholders.
- **Artifact**: An architectural work product that describes an aspect of the architecture.
- **Architecture Contract**: Joint agreements between development partners and sponsors on the deliverables, quality, and fitness-for-purpose of an architecture.
- **Transition Architecture**: A formal description of one state of the architecture at an architecturally significant point in time.
- **Capability Architecture**: Describes the abilities that an enterprise possesses.
- **Strategic Architecture**: Provides an organizing framework for operational and change activity and allows for direction setting at an executive level.

### Techniques
- **Business Scenarios Technique**: Used to help identify, understand, and document business needs, and thereby to derive the business requirements that the architecture development has to address.
- **Gap Analysis**: Highlights shortfalls between the Baseline Architecture and the Target Architecture. To close the gaps, change is needed.
- **Compliance Assessment**: Provides a mechanism to review project progress and ensure that the design and implementation is proceeding in line with the strategic and architectural objectives.

### TOGAF Series Guides
- Security Architecture
- Digital Enterprise & Agile Architecture
- Reference Model for Integrated Information Infrastructure (III-RM)

### Miscellaneous Concepts
- **BDAT**: Stands for the four Architecture Domains: Business, Data, Application, and Technology Architecture.
- **Architecture Landscape**: The architectural representation of assets deployed within the operating enterprise at a particular point in time.
- **Standards Library**: Captures the standards with which new architectures must comply.
- **Architecture Capability**: Defines the parameters, structures, and processes that support governance of the Architecture Repository.
- **Architecture Definition Document**: The deliverable container for the core architectural artifacts created during a project and for important related information.
- **Architecture Roadmap**: Lists individual work packages that will realize the Target Architecture and lays them out on a timeline to show progression from the Baseline Architecture to the Target Architecture.
- **Communications Plan**: Ensures effective communication of targeted information to the right stakeholders at the right time.
- **Architecture Board**: Responsible for achieving goals such as consistency between sub-architectures, enforcement of Architecture Compliance, and improving the maturity level of architecture discipline within the organization.

### Important Notes
- The TOGAF framework recommends that the ADM be adapted to meet the needs of the enterprise and to support different architecture styles.
- The ADM does not mandate that the phases must be performed in any specific sequence or mandate a "waterfall" method.
- The TOGAF Standard describes how the ADM can be used iteratively to develop a comprehensive Enterprise Architecture landscape.
- The TOGAF Standard considers an "enterprise" to be any collection of organizations that have common goals.
- Competing enterprises do not have common goals.
